# MCP Server (STDIO) – Help Desk Tools

This repository contains a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** packaged as a **runnable JAR**, intended to be used by **MCP clients** (for example, Spring AI–based clients or MCP Inspector).

The server runs using **STDIO transport** (not HTTP) and exposes help‑desk–related actions as MCP **tools**. Consumers of this repository are **not expected to read or modify the code**—only to run the JAR and interact with it as an MCP server.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo exists to demonstrate:

* How an MCP Server can be packaged and distributed as a **standalone JAR**
* How MCP tools are exposed and discovered at runtime
* How to test and validate an MCP Server using **MCP Inspector**

If you are building an **MCP client**, this repo acts as a ready‑to‑use MCP server dependency.

---

## 🧠 What This MCP Server Does

The server exposes **help desk actions** as MCP tools.

### Available Tools

* **createTicket**
  Creates a new help‑desk / support ticket

* **getTicketStatus**
  Fetches the status of existing tickets for a given user

These tools are automatically discovered by MCP clients via the MCP protocol.

---

## 🧱 Runtime Characteristics

* **Transport:** STDIO (process input/output)
* **Interface:** MCP protocol (no REST / no HTTP endpoints)
* **Execution Mode:** CLI‑style Java process
* **State:** Uses a local H2 file database

> ⚠️ This server does **not** expose any web URLs. It must be launched and consumed by an MCP‑compatible client.

---

## 📦 How This Server Is Consumed

You interact with this server by:

1. Running the JAR as a process
2. Letting an MCP client communicate with it over STDIO

Typical consumers:

* MCP Inspector (for testing)
* Custom MCP clients
* Spring AI MCP client integrations

---

## 🧪 Testing with MCP Inspector (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

* **Java 17 or higher**
* **Maven**
* **MCP Inspector UI**

---

### Step 2: Build the JAR

From the project root directory:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will generate a runnable JAR inside the `target/` folder.

---

### Step 3: Open MCP Inspector

Launch MCP Inspector in your browser.

---

### Step 4: Configure MCP Inspector

In MCP Inspector, configure the server connection as follows:

#### Transport Type

```
STDIO
```

#### Command

```
java
```

#### Arguments

```
-jar /absolute/path/to/target/<generated-jar-name>.jar
```

Example:

```
-jar /Users/yourname/projects/mcp-server-stdio/target/mcp-server-stdio-1.0.0.jar
```

> ℹ️ Always use an **absolute path** to the JAR file.

---

### Step 5: Connect

* Click **Connect** in MCP Inspector
* Status should change to **Connected**

At this point, MCP Inspector has successfully started your server as a child process.

---

### Step 6: Discover Tools

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Click **List Tools**

You should see:

* `createTicket`
* `getTicketStatus`

This confirms that the MCP handshake and capability discovery worked correctly.

---

### Step 7: Execute a Tool

Example flow:

* Select **getTicketStatus**
* Provide a username (for example: `ashwani`)
* Click **Run Tool**

The response returned is generated by the MCP server via STDIO.

---

## 🔍 How to Validate the Server Is Working

The server is functioning correctly if:

* MCP Inspector shows **Connected**
* Tools appear under **List Tools**
* Tool execution returns structured responses
* No STDIO errors appear in the Inspector logs

---

## 📌 When to Use This MCP Server

This setup is ideal when:

* You want a **local MCP server** without networking
* You are developing or testing an MCP client
* You want a lightweight, secure tool execution model

---

## ✅ Summary

* This repository provides a **ready‑to‑run MCP Server JAR**
* No code changes are required to use it
* MCP Inspector is the easiest way to test and explore the exposed tools
* Designed to be consumed directly by MCP clients

---

If you are building an MCP client, simply treat this project as a **tool‑providing MCP server binary** and integrate it accordingly.
